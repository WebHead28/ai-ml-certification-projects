# AI & ML Certification Projects

This repository contains machine learning programs developed as part of my AI & ML certification coursework.
The focus of these projects is on understanding data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Projects Included

### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression
- Concepts: Data cleaning, feature encoding, train-test split, model evaluation
- Objective: Predict passenger survival based on demographic features

### 2. Handwritten Digit Recognition
- Algorithm: Support Vector Machine (Linear Kernel)
- Concepts: Image data handling, reshaping, classification
- Objective: Recognize handwritten digits from image data

### 3. Telecom Customer Prediction
- Algorithm: XGBoost Classifier
- Concepts: Feature engineering, ensemble learning, performance metrics
- Objective: Predict customer outcomes based on telecom usage data

## Notes
These programs were developed as part of structured coursework and enhanced using experimentation and iteration.
They represent foundational machine learning concepts that support my ongoing work in Generative AI.
